Some of the functions used in the first part of the simulation code:

* [`range(stop)`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#range)
  returns a sequence of integers from 0 to stop (excluding).

* [`print(objects)`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print)
  prints objects to the text stream file.

* [`numpy.zeros(shape, dtype)`](
  https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.zeros.html)
  returns an array of specified shape and data type, initialized with zeros.

* [`numpy.random.randint(high, size)`](
  https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generated/numpy.random.randint.html)
  returns an array of shape "size", initialized with random integers between
  0 and high (excluding).

* [`numpy.take(array, indices, axis)`](
  https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.take.html)
  returns elements at indices from an array along an axis.

* [`numpy.cumsum(array, axis)`](
  https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.cumsum.html)
  returns the cumulative sum of an array along a specified axis.
  For example, `numpy.cumsum([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], axis=1)` is
  `[[1, 3, 6], [4, 9, 15]]`.

* [`numpy.mean(array, axis)`](
  https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.mean.html)
  returns the average of the elements along axis.

* [`numpy.arange(stop)`](
  https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.arange.html)
  returns evenly spaced values up to stop.

* [`numpy.linalg.lstsq(a, b)`](
  https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.lstsq.html)
  returns the least-squares solution to a linear matrix equation, i.e. it
  computes the vector `x` that approximately solves the equation `a @ x = b`.

* [`array[..., numpy.newaxis]`](
  https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/constants.html#numpy.newaxis)
  appends a new dimension of size 1 to the array, e.g. to turn a vector into
  a matrix.

* [`array[index]`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.indexing.html)
  returns the value(s) of the array at the position(s) specified by index.
